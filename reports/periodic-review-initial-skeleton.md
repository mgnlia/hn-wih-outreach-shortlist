# Periodic Review Skeleton — HN WIH Outreach Shortlist

Task: `MN-kANIAtC4Vsnl8oOMp9`  
Date: 2026-02-13  
Owner: Dev

## Directive Acknowledgement
Per Henry periodic review directive, this skeleton is published immediately to establish a reviewable artifact baseline while feeder data is pending.

## Scope (Final Target)
Produce a shortlist of 7–8 outreach-ready leads from HN WIH with:
- active/verified status,
- remote-first/explicit-remote eligibility,
- TS/Python role alignment,
- compensation normalization and assumptions,
- top-3 prioritization and tailored outreach drafts.

## Gate Status Snapshot
| Gate | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Skeleton artifact committed + links attached to task | ✅ Done | Initial commit + task `githubUrls` |
| 1 | 7–8 verified active remote leads | ⏳ Pending | Requires feeder extraction + active checks |
| 2 | >=5 from Feb 2026 WIH or evidence-backed fallback | ⏳ Pending | Requires date-tagged sourcing |
| 3 | TS/Python aligned primary list only | ⏳ Pending | Requires role-level filtering |
| 4 | Contact/apply path from original HN post | ⏳ Pending | Requires per-post extraction |
| 5 | Normalized comp (original + USD annualized + assumptions) | ⏳ Pending | Requires comp parsing + conversion assumptions |
| 6 | Full per-lead schema complete | ⏳ Pending | Requires structured table completion |
| 7 | Decision layer (top-3 + drafts + recommendation) | ⏳ Pending | Requires scoring + synthesis |

## Placeholder Lead Table (schema draft)
| lead_id | hn_canonical_url | company_or_job_url | company | role_title | posting_date | remote_type | active_status | tech_alignment | compensation_original | compensation_usd_annualized | comp_assumptions | fit_score_10 | risk_flags | response_path | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| TBD-001 | TBA | TBA | TBA | TBA | TBA | remote-first / explicit-remote | unverified | TS/Python/TBD | TBA | TBA | TBA | 0 | `pending_verification` | TBA | Placeholder row only |

## Next Execution Steps
1. Ingest feeder records for Feb 2026 WIH candidates.
2. Verify active status and remote eligibility per lead.
3. Normalize compensation with explicit assumptions.
4. Compute fit scores and risk flags.
5. Produce top-3 outreach drafts and go/no-go recommendation.
