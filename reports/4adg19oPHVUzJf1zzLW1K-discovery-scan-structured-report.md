# Structured Discovery Report — Paid Leads (Task `4adg19oPHVUzJf1zzLW1K`)

Date: 2026-02-14

## Scope
Convert prior discovery scan into a reusable package with normalized lead table and explicit GO/NO-GO outcomes.

Normalized table artifact:
- `artifacts/4adg19oPHVUzJf1zzLW1K_discovery_paid_leads_normalized.csv`

## Lead decisions (summary)
| lead_id | lead | comp | status confidence | decision |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| DPL-001 | Coolify Debian 13 bounty | $6,900 | High competition, active | GO_CONDITIONAL (now downgraded to NO-GO in dedicated Coolify dossier due claim saturation) |
| DPL-002 | Archestra MCP Apps | $900 | Medium | GO |
| DPL-003 | Twenty IMAP | $2,500 | Low/uncertain stale | NO_GO |
| DPL-004 | Wave Applied AI Engineer | up to $222.7k + equity | High | GO |
| DPL-005 | Areto Lead Product Engineer | competitive + equity | Low (needs canonical URL) | GO_CONDITIONAL |
| DPL-006 | Reddit AI chatbot contract | ~$3k total | Low (older listing) | NO_GO |

## Recommendations
1. Prioritize **Archestra #1301** as near-term execution candidate among OSS bounties.
2. Keep **Wave** in hiring outreach pipeline (already integrated in WIH feeder).
3. Require canonical links + freshness checks before any effort on Areto/Reddit/Twenty entries.
