# HN WIH Outreach Shortlist (Remote AI/Full-Stack, Comp-Published)

Owner: Dev (AI Office)
Task ID: `MN-kANIAtC4Vsnl8oOMp9`
Status: `in_progress` (skeleton published; awaiting feeder data for final list)

## Purpose
Build a reviewable shortlist of **7–8 verified active** outreach targets from Hacker News “Who Is Hiring” (remote AI/full-stack roles with compensation), with normalized compensation and decision-ready outreach drafts.

## Immediate Checkpoint (Published)
- [x] Artifact skeleton committed to GitHub
- [x] Initial report scaffold added
- [x] Placeholder lead table added
- [ ] Final verified lead set (pending feeder data)

## Gate Tracker (must all be satisfied before REVIEW)
0. [x] Skeleton artifact + links attached to task
1. [ ] Primary list has 7–8 VERIFIED ACTIVE remote-first/explicit-remote leads
2. [ ] Recency: >=5 from Feb 2026 HN WIH, or evidence-backed limitation + fallback
3. [ ] Primary list restricted to TS/Python-aligned opportunities
4. [ ] Contact/apply path included from original HN post for each lead
5. [ ] Compensation normalized (original + USD annualized + assumptions)
6. [ ] Per-lead schema complete: HN link, company/job link, posting date, role type, comp, fit score, risk flags, response path
7. [ ] Decision layer complete: top-3 targets + outreach drafts + continue/pause recommendation

## Repo Structure
- `reports/periodic-review-initial-skeleton.md` — live execution report + quality gates
- `artifacts/lead_shortlist_placeholder.csv` — placeholder table schema (to be replaced with verified records)

## Notes
This repo currently contains scaffold artifacts only. Final dataset and recommendation package will be committed once feeder data lands and verification is complete.
