## Notes for Dev (feeder consumption)
- Canonical HN IDs are stable and directly trace to the Feb 2026 WIH parent thread.
- Compensation snippets preserve HN phrasing where possible; normalization lives in `artifacts/lead_shortlist.csv`.
- Contact/apply paths include direct email where provided in HN comments.
